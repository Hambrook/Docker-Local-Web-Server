#Docker Local Web Server

###Nginx or Apache? PHP 7 or 5? How about every permutation at once?

This is a set of containers that let you host multiple websites with different server configurations. Choose between Nginx or Apache, PHP7 or PHP5. There's also MySQL and phpMyAdmin in there too.

##Requirements

You need Docker and Docker Compose. These installation instructions differ depending on your platform, but can be found [here for Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) and [here for Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

##Installation and Configuration

* Clone this repo (`git clone https://github.com/Hambrook/Docker-Local-Web-Server.git`)
* Then enter the directory and open the `docker-compose.yml` file. Update the "/data" paths to your local web root.
* Open up your terminal, navigate to the directory containing the `docker-compose.yml` file and run `sudo docker-compose up -d`

##Configuring Vhosts

There are 4 vhosts already configured:

* localhost-n5 = Nginx, PHP5
* localhost-n7 = Nginx, PHP7
* localhost-a5 = Apache, PHP5
* localhost-a7 = Apache, PHP7

Remember to add these hosts to your `hosts` file:
    localhost-n5 127.0.0.1
    localhost-n7 127.0.0.1
    localhost-a5 127.0.0.1
    localhost-a7 127.0.0.1

To create a new website, just copy either one of the files in `nginx/vhosts/` that matches what you're setting up (eg localhost-n7 is Nginx with PHP7), rename and update it to match the hostname you're setting up.

Creating a new Apache website also involves creating an Apache vhost. Go into either `php5-apache/vhosts/` or `php7-apache/vhosts/` and create your vhost there.

Restart the servers by running `sudo docker-compose up -d` and your new sites should work.

##Database
The MariaDB and MySQL instances use the usernames/passwords of root/root. All containers have access to these containers via `mariadb:3306` and `mysql:3306`. The host can also access MariaDB via `localhost:3306` and MySQL via `localhost:3308`.

You can also use phpMyAdmin via http://localhost:1234/ to log into either database server using mariadb or mysql and root/root.

##Installed Modules
A number of modules are already installed, and this list may expand.

###PHP7

* bcmath
* iconv
* mbstring
* mcrypt
* mysqli
* pdo_mysql

###PHP5

* bz2
* curl
* gd
* iconv
* imap
* mbstring
* mysqli
* pdo_mysql

###Apache

* rewrite

##FAQ
###Why?
Because I need to develop for modern servers while also maintaining legacy systems. I did have each configuration as a separate Docker Composer config so I could stop the Nginx/PHP7 server and start the Apache/PHP5 one, but this is easier.

###Does data get lost when the containers are stopped or rebuilt?
Your website files and database will be retained, but any logs will be lost. Feel free to pipe them to specific outputs if you wish.

###Why are the images so big?
I'm using the default Docker images where possible, and they haven't made the move to being based on Alpine yet. Hopefully they catch up.

##Feedback
Tell me if you loved it. Tell me if you hated it. Tell me if you used it and thought "meh". I'm keen to hear your feedback.

##Roadmap
* Add xDebug
* Add SSL
* Make it easier to customise web roots
* Update to use one Apache container that references the PHP FPM containers
* Move to lighter weight containers, or just wait for them to migrate to Alphine or something
* Rename this package to something better
* _If you have an idea, [let me know](https://github.com/Hambrook/Docker-Local-Web-Server/issues)._
